# RiverWatch

The RiverWatch android app is a open source multi function app that acts as a way
for people to test the quality of Rivers. The app is made up of four modules:
nitrate/nitrite strip testing, incident reporting, a companion for using the
hardware device and a history section of the previous three modules.

### Nitrate/nitrite testing

The nitrate/nitrite testing functionality is used in conjunction with special
strips that can be found at this [website](http://www.hach.com/nitrate-and-nitrite-test-strips/product?id=7640211606),
the strips are first photographed and then processed in an algorith to give a
rough estimation of the level of nitrate/nitrite that is in the water.

### Incident reports

With the Riverwatch app you can take a geotagged image and send it to the WAINZ website.
The picture can include a report or description. Once approved it will appear on
the New Zealand map on the WAINZ website. Often water pollution goes undetected,
use your phone app and watch our rivers, lakes and streams get healthy again.

### Hardware device
The bluetooth module is meant to be a act as a companion to the hardware device,
it can be used to grab the data from the hardware device and process it into
readable data which is then sent to the website.

### History
This module details the past submissions of each of the above modules, this will
include relevant data on each item and with the data from the hardware device
various graphs will be created to easily see the data.
